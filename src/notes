ToDo
Character Changes:

Status effects {flame,bleed,freezing,overheating,frosted,slowed,weakened,holyDown}

Buff effects {holyLight, holyBlessing, rally, bulk up}

Level progression system unique to character type (archer has a choice of three options for stat line set up)

Enemy type declaration

Within each Character create the status effect that would likely collide with them (warrior - bleed, archer - bleed, priest - holyDown, mage - flame,freezing,frosted,bleed.
_______________________
JFrame:
Create a base template for a 2d model traversal with randomly initiated attacks

Import images for items such as weapons and consumables

Implement the number system for consumable items

Make a moveable sprite character that shows the movement of a whole party.

_______________________
Behaviour file:

I want to use this file to implement turn based combat

Before even starting this JFrame must be fleshed out to some extent as well as having the randomly initiated attacks implemented
